# README Generator

# Description

 It is very important to have a high-quality README for any application or project. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues.
You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. and that is why I just created the best README generator for you!!.
